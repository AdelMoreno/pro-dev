		<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
		<p>Hi, my name is Adel.
			I am currently training to be a web developer so that I can provide a better life for my fiance and I.
			I am a student at Deep Dive Coding.
			Have you heard of Deep Dive Coding or do you know someone who has attended?

	<h2>Forbidden Island Reflections</h2>
	<p>My team consisted of Joe, Asya, Jude, and I. I found out that we work really well together as a team. Everyone is willing
	to give their input on the best course of action. Joe is good leader, and helped us get through the game. Asya wasn't afraid
	to ask for help if their was an aspect that she didn't understand. I think that shows that she trusts and values our input.
	Jude was good at helping out and giving advice when we got in a tough spot. I wasn't afraid to share my opinion even if
	it went against something else someone said. Sometimes it turned out to be a good idea and sometimes it did not. But,
	I felt that I was able to observe and give good advice during the game.</p>

		<h2>Persuasion Activity</h2>
		<ol class="list text-left">
			<li>I've been told by some people that I'm smart and that I'm really good with technology. I'm not sure
			that I believe them. I feel that I have always just tried my best and really applied myself to the things
			that I want to do.</li>
			<li>I think I have a hard time believing that I can do something. I get worried that I will fail, or that
			the end result won't be good enough. I need to learn that sometimes its ok to fail, as long as I don't quit
			and keep trying.</li>
			<li>I feel that I create value for others by always being willing to help whenever I can. This helps things
				keep moving in the workplace whenever a problem arises.I enjoy working alongside others to solve a problem. </li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Stovetop</h2>
			<ol class="list mb-5 text-left">
				<li>Ask talent manager about web developer opportunities at my current job.</li>
				<li>Attend meetups to see if I can volunteer and network myself</li>
				<li>Work with workforce connections and NMITAP</li>
				<li>Develop a better online presence by making more connections on LinkedIn and other social sites.</li>

		<h2 class="mt-5">Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>I am now able to quickly make a small html file.
			I can also set it up on the bootcamp serve and github much faster than I could before.
			I've learned quite a bit this week and <b>excited</b> for what next week will bring!</p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>I can set up a project in github and bootcamp server without any notes.
		I can now make tables in sql. I can also make classes and methods in sql.
		I can also make constructors in sql!</p>
		<h3>Week 3</h3>
		<p>I've been put into my group for the Capstone project, and have started work on Lost Paws (name of the project).
		I'm really excited because if we are able to make a really great website, it could help lost pets and their owners.
		I feel like I need to do more studying on PHP to get a better understanding of accessors and mutators. I think
		I did really well on the CSS challenge. Although, I feel like I made things more difficult than it should have been.
		I will need to practice more, so I don't have to write as many rules to get the desired layout.</p>
		<h3>Week 4</h3>
		<p>I've been working on writing accessors and mutators for the class that I was assigned. I wasn't very confident
		at writing them when I first started, but I feel like I am getting better at it. I also feel that I'm starting
		to get more of an understanding of the code that we have been writing. I definitely preferred writing code
		for the bootstrap challenge. I am pretty sure that I enjoy working on the front end more than the back end,
		but I suppose that could change. I enjoy coding because it allows me to create websites that are aesthetically
		pleasing. It also allows me to be a little bit creative in how I set the layout and design of the site.</p>
		<h3>Week 5</h3>
		<p>I've finished writing the pdo statements for my assigned class. It felt really good when my ticket on asana
		was burned, and I was able to move on to the next task. The team is working really great together and I'm grateful
		for that. I also finished my javascript challenge. It was hard, but I think I did a good job on it. I will find
		out the results for that soon. My pwp is starting to come along. I have most of the basic layout set up and now
		I just need to fill it out with content. I enjoy coding because I am to build something and be proud of what
		I have built.</p>
		<h3>Week 6</h3>
		<p>My team has finished writing our API's and now we are working on testing them. I feel like we are
		really making progress, and our project is taking shape. I'm excited to learn more about the front end.
		We have started learning Angular, and Typescript looks really interesting. The example I followed for making
		my API needed to be corrected, so I had to go back and correct mine. I'm hoping that I fixed everything I
		needed to. Our group is going to Crepes and Coding on Saturday to fix all the bugs with our APIs. This is the
		first time we will getting together outside of class, and I'm excited for that! I enjoy coding because
		because it allows me to make websites that are aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.</p>
		<h3>Week 7</h3>
		<p>My team and I finished our services and interfaces in Angular. We started making our static UI, and are almost done!
		I feel like we are making very good progress! George said we are ahead and will have plenty of time to add extra
		functionality if we choose to. We have our HR and technical interviews next week. I'm nervous for both, but I
		think the technical part is what scares me the most. I have started doing some deeper studying into Javascript because
		I was told that it was very important. I will be meeting with some classmates to study some more Javascript this weekend,
		and I am excited for that. I can't believe there are only three weeks left! We will all be graduating soon, and I'm excited
		for what will be happening next! I enjoy coding because it allows me to create websites that are aesthetically and
		functionally please for the user.</p>
		<h3>Week 8</h3>
		<p>The team finished our static UI. We ran into a problem of the profile name not showing up when someone posts a
		comment. Joe and Jude had to go back to data design and make a method for an API to use to get it. That might set us
		back a little bit, but I think we are still ahead. I'm not sure what is up next in the project, I'm having a hard
		time understanding Angular. Joe has been really nice and helping me with the part of the project that I was assigned
		to do in Angular. I will spend some time trying to study some more Angular so that I will have a better understanding
		of what we are working on next week. I'm almost done with my pwp, and I finished my contact form this week! It now
		sends an email to me when the contact form is submitted. I will work on doing the finishing touches this weekend, and
		will be ready to deploy it on a live site next week. I think the interviews went really well! I'm glad that I was able
		to get some feedback and what I can work on to improve. I enjoy coding because it allows me to create things, and then
		take pride in the work and challenges I had to go through to get the finished project.</p>
		<h3>Week 9</h3>
		<p class="mb-5">The team has finished a great amount of work this week! Our website is just about done, there is only a few
		things left that need to be worked out. There isn't much that needs to be done this weekend, so it will be a nice
		break before we have to work on our deployment next week. I am still having a hard time with angular, and will use
		this free time during the weekend to study. I was given a really hard task in angular that didn't have any examples
		to follow, and it got to the point where even the instructors really had to think about how to get it to work. I feel
		like I was able to be more helpful during the bootstrap and design refinement of the website. I think that those are
		my strengths. I have to work with the group on our presentation, but for not planning it out very much I think we did
		pretty well. I'm super excited to graduate next week and see what the future will bring! I enjoy the design part of coding.
		I enjoy doing the layouts and picking colors. I enjoy the UI/UX element of making a website functional, but also aesthetically
		pleasing.</p>

	<p>When employers do a google search for me, one of the first things that pops up is Facebook. This is one of my personal
	accounts, and I have all the settings set to private. The next thing that shows up is my LinkedIn. I think this could
	be beneficial, however in the title it shows assistant administrative coordinator. This could hurt me when I'm trying
	to find employment in the technology sector. There is also a twitter and instagram account that shows up, but
	neither one of those is mine. I will need to increase my activity in at least my professional twitter, so I that will
	be the site that shows up instead.</p>

		<p>Hi, my name is Adel.

			I am a student at Deep Dive Coding.
			Have you heard of Deep Dive Coding or do you know someone who has attended?

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Week 0</h3>
		<p>I am now able to quickly make a small html file.
			I can also set it up on the bootcamp serve and github much faster than I could before.
			I've learned quite a bit this week and <b>excited</b> for what next week will bring!</p>
		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>I can set up a project in github and bootcamp server without any notes.
		I can now make tables in sql. I can also make classes and methods in sql.
		I can also make constructors in sql!</p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>I've been put into my group for the Capstone project, and have started work on Lost Paws (name of the project).
		I'm really excited because if we are able to make a really great website, it could help lost pets and their owners.
		I feel like I need to do more studying on PHP to get a better understanding of accessors and mutators. I think
		I did really well on the CSS challenge. Although, I feel like I made things more difficult than it should have been.
		I will need to practice more, so I don't have to write as many rules to get the desired layout.</p>

	<p>When employers do a google search for me, one of the first things that pops up is Facebook. This is one of my personal
	accounts, and I have all the settings set to private. The next thing that shows up is my LinkedIn. I think this could
	be beneficial, however in the title it shows assistant administrative coordinator. This could hurt me when I'm trying
	to find employment in the technology sector. There is also a twitter and instagram account that shows up, but
	neither one of those is mine. I will need to increase my activity in at least my proffesional twitter, so I that will
	be the site that shows up instead.</p>

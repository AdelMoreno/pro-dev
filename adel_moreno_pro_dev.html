	<h2>Forbidden Island Reflections</h2>
	<p>My team consisted of Joe, Asya, Jude, and I. I found out that we work really well together as a team. Everyone is willing
	to give their input on the best course of action. Joe is good leader, and helped us get through the game. Asya wasn't afraid
	to ask for help if their was an aspect that she didn't understand. I think that shows that she trusts and values our input.
	Jude was good at helping out and giving advice when we got in a tough spot. I wasn't afraid to share my opinion even if
	it went against something else someone said. Sometimes it turned out to be a good idea and sometimes it did not. But,
	I felt that I was able to observe and give good advice during the game.</p>

		<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
		<br>
		<h3>Week 1</h3>
		<p>I am now able to quickly make a small html file.
			I can also set it up on the bootcamp serve and github much faster than I could before.
			I've learned quite a bit this week and <b>excited</b> for what next week will bring!</p>
		<h3>Week 2</h3>
		<p>I can set up a project in github and bootcamp server without any notes.
		I can now make tables in sql. I can also make classes and methods in sql.
		I can also make constructors in sql!</p>
		<h3>Week 3</h3>
		<p>I've been put into my group for the Capstone project, and have started work on Lost Paws (name of the project).
		I'm really excited because if we are able to make a really great website, it could help lost pets and their owners.
		I feel like I need to do more studying on PHP to get a better understanding of accessors and mutators. I think
		I did really well on the CSS challenge. Although, I feel like I made things more difficult than it should have been.
		I will need to practice more, so I don't have to write as many rules to get the desired layout.</p>
		<h3>Week 4</h3>
		<p>I've been working on writing accessors and mutators for the class that I was assigned. I wasn't very confident
		at writing them when I first started, but I feel like I am getting better at it. I also feel that I'm starting
		to get more of an understanding of the code that we have been writing. I definitely preferred writing code
		for the bootstrap challenge. I am pretty sure that I enjoy working on the front end more than the back end,
		but I suppose that could change. I enjoy coding because it allows me to create websites that are aesthetically
		pleasing. It also allows me to be a little bit creative in how I set the layout and design of the site.</p>

	<p>When employers do a google search for me, one of the first things that pops up is Facebook. This is one of my personal
	accounts, and I have all the settings set to private. The next thing that shows up is my LinkedIn. I think this could
	be beneficial, however in the title it shows assistant administrative coordinator. This could hurt me when I'm trying
	to find employment in the technology sector. There is also a twitter and instagram account that shows up, but
	neither one of those is mine. I will need to increase my activity in at least my proffesional twitter, so I that will
	be the site that shows up instead.</p>
